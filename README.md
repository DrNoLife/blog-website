# blog-website

A basic blog'ish website, created using C# and Blazor.

# Overview

As it stands right now, this is nothing but an idea. I need to find the time to actually create it. 

Throughout the project I'll also be creating some artifacts including some basic site designs, which should hopefully make it easier to create the UI.

# Requirements

The requirements are not completely set in stone yet, but as it stands right now I want these features.

- Azure AD B2C authentication and authorization system.
- Hompage with a list of recent posts.
- Blog post page.
- Ability to add multiple tags to a post.
- Ability for users to search by tags.
- Commenting on posts.
- Search system.
- Markdown support.
- Archive system (and further option to completely delete a post).
- Mailing list.
- API / Client design.
- Response design for both desktop and mobile (but desktop first).
- "I am not a robot" verification for mailing list.
- Ability to pin a blog post to the frontpage (only one post can be featured, so this will overwrite the previous one. If none is selected, just display in chronological order).

As mentioned, the requirements are not set in stone yet...
